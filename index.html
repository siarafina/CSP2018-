My name is Sophia R. Tucker, I am a senior at STEM ECHS with a 3.65 GPA. I am finishing up both high school and my associates and plan to be a geologist in the future. The experience I have in this field are several summers and break exploring different dig-sites and catalogging several minerals, fossils, shells that i've found.

  During my freetime, I enjoy reading, playing videogames, searching for fossils, and hanging out with friends.
